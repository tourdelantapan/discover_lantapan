The first residence was called Lantapan which was located along Kulasihan creek with a distance of about four (4) kilometers from the north so that natives could easily saw at sight strange people at Manupali River climbing up to this place where the natives lived. Because during those time, there were “Bandidos Moros" that came from Lanao, who had a culture of crossing Manupali to capture natives’ women and animals especially horses. Most often the Bandidos got what they want because they were more powerful compared to the poor natives of Lantapan. In fact, “Muslim Bandidos” had plenty of fighting equipment and they were so many in numbers than the natives. One day, Moros attacked Poblacion natives. Great war happened between the two opposing groups. In just a few whiles, there was a man carrying *kalasag’ and “lambitan". He helped the natives. He fought against Muslims. Then due to his alertness and good techniques in fighting, plenty of moros died until there was only one Muslim left. This Moro alone who was the leader of the bandidos Bandidos group surrendered and was sent to the native’s leader. With this event the said Moros were given an order by the natives not to cross the Manupali again. Lantapanons planted bamboos below the river of Manupali “Tlaya”., for their assurance that moros will not oppose the order. The brave and handsome man who help the natives was “AGYU" who was sent by the anitos - the good spirit who protected Lantapanons according to re natives. From then on, the said place was named “Lantap" or Poblacion Lantapan taken from the word “Kusog Molantap", meaning to say the quick and brave “Agyu” as he fought against Moros. As the war ended the strange man Agyu also disappeared. One saddest moment came into the lives of the Lantapanons. Drought came in a way for twelve years. Kulasihan and Alanib Rivers were then totally collapsed. Only Manupali River survived with little amount of water.
