Before the out break of World War II, Kulasihan was a part of Bugcaon and it was used to be farm lots. It would be realized that during early days Bukidnon Province was a forested place. However, because of the practiced of cutting trees or making kaingin it resulted to the drying of Kulasihan Creek during dry seasons, unlike before when water continuously present during drought season.

Since this was a farm lot, farmer used to let their working animals along the riverbank which resulted to the total dry up of the creek that farmers found it difficult to fetch their water. There is however a portion which does not get dry even in long drought that only wild chickens and drank there. This became a permanent drinking place for them.

One of the birds which frequently drank here attracted the attention of the farmer which is the “Colasisi”. They were attracted by its color and sound.

The “Binukid” for the word “drank” caries when they mean people of animals. They say “inum” when they mean people, for birds and fowls they say “sisim”. On their occasional conversation when they mention the place where the kulasisi drinks, they say “sisiman ho Kulasisi”. It was too long for them to say the words so, they simlu call it “Kulasihan” derived from the workd “kulasisi-sisiman”.

On the later part of 1950’s a councilman of Bugcaon established his regular barrio. He was the first barangay lieutenant in this place. After his term he did not file his candidacy, but it was Mr. Felix C. Ponferrada who did it.

He was the firs ekected barrio lieutenant if Kulasihan in the Calendar Year 1959-1960. In the year 1960, the barangay people put up a Parent-Teacher Association, made public school building whose materials and school site was donated by Mr. Valeriano Bueno.

That’s why VALBUECO ELEMENTARY SCHOOL is the name if the school instead of KULASIHAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL because of the donation of Mr. Valeriano Bueno.
