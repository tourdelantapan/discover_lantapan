Long time ago there was an area which was covered with very thick vegetations. Everywhere you go, you couldn’t see nor hear anything except trees and the singing of birds and the roaring of wildlife. There was no sign of existence.

As time passed by, it is an instinct of man to improve his way of living, a group of people by the name Mansalayan, Bernardo Binatao as well as Manemon agreed to migrate this place. They started making kaingin in order that they could plant for their living. They had plenty of products as well as animals.

Life then, during that time was so nice for everybody and each one were contented. There were harmony among them. Nothing to fear of love for one another were always in the air. They married and bear children, until they increased in number. 

How Cawayan got its name? Mansalayan, an old man from Mirayon, planted cawayan at the beginning he settled on that place. He planted the cawayan on the creek which was then supposedly a dead one. As first, the bamboo was growing fine until it became very thick. There developed a spring at its’ base. It became a source of water for the people. Every time the people fetched water, they cut a stem to be used as “water container”. Until such time, the said bamboo groove died. The creek was name “cawayan”. From that time ip to the present, the place was then called CAWAYAN. 

Now, the place is inhabited by people coming from the different place like Mountain Province, Bicol, Cantral Luzon, Bohol and other Visayan Tribes as well as tribes from Mindanao itself.
