Long before the World War II, this place was yet a vast forest where old folks usually hunt fir wild nuts and animals for food. This vast forest was full of big trees and the weather and climate is so cold that cold not even dry the clothes unless hanged it near a fire and called in native dialect as “Daing” or dalaingan.

It was the first bane called to the barangay, because all day long it covered with fogs, and it is very-very cold. It usually a place where frogs called “antig” lived. But after a period of transition, it was found out that this place was good for vegetables. So, the people from the neighboring barangay came to reside along the Pinamangohan Hill.

In 1952, an active Board Member name Victor Sulatan saw this group of Bukidnon Tribe and grouped them into a unit of government. He appointed a barangay leader called “datu” in the person of Ramon Lawahan. That time the name “dalaingan” as being the name of barangay was changed to “LIBERTY”.

After several years, the people had a bad concept of the word “liberty” this it was change by Alcalde Juan Melendez, a Capitan del Barrio of Malaybalay who was famous of his good work during Spanish time, and that is why “Capitan Juan” got its name.
