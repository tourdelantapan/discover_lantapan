Long time ago there was a small plant called “Lila”. The People wonder why it grew abundantly in that area. They took some leaves and found out that it can be used as “Tina” (dye) to change white to violet color. So, some people regularly used it to dye their native products particularly to generate livelihood as a, means for their living. 

Early in 1950’s, the founders Juan Rubin, Gelacio Montecillo and others had a petition to make sitio became a barangay. So, Mr. Juan Rubin went back to Cebu to convinced some Cebuano’s  so that its population would increase, thereby it would be qualified to became a barrio.

As time passed the place was formally separated from Poblcaion, the mother barrio under R.A 2370 last December 23, 1956. From small plant “Lila” it became BALILA, meaning people of Balila.
