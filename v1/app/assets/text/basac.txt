Early in 1300 A.D., no name yet had been given to the place but there were already three native families living. During nomadic period, there lived a gallant hunter at the foot of Mount Kitanglad Range named “TUGASAN” which now a days deritively known as TUGASAN RIVER.

Once cheerful morning, gallant Tugasan primitively sailed his bamboo raft loaded with wild animals, rattan and any other native crops sailing down to venture somewhere on the south to exchange goods. Unluckily, he met danger on his voyage. The great and fierce current of the river resulted to ruined his bamboo raft. The following day gallant Tugasan was found dead, upheld under a huge and very tall tree near at the riverbank. 

Precisely, that huge and tall tree was the only tree grown at that place as the native dialect says “Bugtong” meaning “Alone” or rather shall we say “The only tree” because the rest of the land were tract of wide vast of cogon grasses.

In 18 A.D. a missionary Jesuit priest came across to see a mission in this place. The missionary priest inquired some historical events since the native were too hesitant to tell.
