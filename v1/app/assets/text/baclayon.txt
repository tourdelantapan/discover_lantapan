Baclayon was taken from the native word “Hipanaw” which means “To hike”. Old folks says that before. The people used to commute from Lantapan using a possible short cut route which they passed through a small and dangerous road.

Due to some unknown incidents that happened along the main road of Lantapan, the commuter decides to just passed through that short cut route by hiking even though how dangerous the road was.

They usually passed that road going to Alanib which the natives’ term that as “layon”, meaning “to go”. They always say “Hipanaw” or “Baclay” in Bisaya term. 

Until such time that they called the place as BACLAYON, meaning “to go hiking”. That’s why the name “BACLAYON” come its existence.
