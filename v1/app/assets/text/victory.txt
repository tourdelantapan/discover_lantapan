Barangay Victory is a community of the Bukidnon Tribe, formerly known as “Bontongon”, who got its name and identified by the bamboo groves that is found in thick forest. Bontong in our dialect means “Bamboo”.

The first inhabitants were the Anggayans, the family of Datu Maluntawon and followed by the Gao-ids. The Anggayans and Gao-ids made a division of land among themselves, considering nature boundaries like Kimanga Creek, Bagobawon Creek and the Kinontawon Creek as markers of boundaries for them. Later on, the Anke’s and the Sihayan’s joined the group and given share of the land to their heirs which constitute new boundaries within the land making used of identical trees as markers and planting bamboos between these trees. 

Barangay Victory is presently populated with 90% Bukidnon Tribe and the remaining 10% different tribes. Barangay Victory was then officially created under R.A. 3590.
