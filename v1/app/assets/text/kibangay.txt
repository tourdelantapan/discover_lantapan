Before the World War II, the brangay which is now called “KIBANGAY” was a thick forest with only few houses and few people. People were far from civilization. Only fact trails used in going in and out of their places. Pure natives, mostly kaingeros penetrated the place. These natives used crude tool and utensils and lived only by hunting bees and wild animals. The ways of living was purely primitive.

One of the crude utensils common those days were the wooden cups, plates, and basins, they names as “bangay” wood basin were used as planter for serving food as well as for washing.

It happened that a stranger come and asked the name of the place. Because they didn’t understand, they just pointed out to a wooden utensil and uttered “bangay”. From that time, it was name BANGAY because in that group of neighborhoods, everybody were equipped with “Bangay”.

Later on after making utterance this term was change from BANGAY to “KIBANGAY” deriving it from the wooden basin as used long time ago.
